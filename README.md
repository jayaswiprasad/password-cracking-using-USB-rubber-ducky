# password-cracking-using-USB-rubber-ducky

The project aims to implement Script injection and keystroke injection attacks, which can execute malicious commands via a thumb drive connected to a host machine, by running the code that mimics keystrokes entered by a human user. 

USB Rubber ducky is like a hacking tool that looks like a pen drive. This is useful to steal victims’ essential and credential data by injecting payload into the USB Rubber ducky and connecting it to the victim's computers. We will plug the USB rubber ducky into the victim’s device and the script will automatically run through HID (Human Interface Device) means the computer thinks that the signals are coming from the keyboard and mouse and neither device’s firewall nor the anti-virus software can detect it.

Algorithm: 
Brute force:
Brute force is a simple attack method and has a high success rate. Some attackers use applications and scripts as brute-force tools. These tools try out numerous password combinations to bypass authentication processes.
